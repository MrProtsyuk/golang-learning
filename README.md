## GOLANG Learning

Hey if you've found this repo you will have found my go lang project folder where I bascially learned a bunch of go lang concepts and made some projects. The details behind some of the folders in here will be found below !

# Deck 0f cards, Hello go, and even odd

My first few go projects! Deck of cards was a project I had built with a Udemy course. Essentially what it does is it creates randomize deck of cards and can shuffle the cards. Even odd was a similar project but it involved checking if a number was even or off and telling the user in the terminal. Hello go was the first and its bascially a hello world file.

# Maps, structs

# Web-Server

My first actual web server built with Go. Includes two html files and one go file. The project can be run from the go-server folder by type go build first and then go run main.go. The server will be on 8080, and to create a form go to /form.html
